Q. 3)
You are working in Country “XYZ”, for an organisation which works standard tables for mortality rates. Your colleague has collected the data and calculated the mortality rates. Two sets of graduation on the data have been performed.
The data file “Std_Table.csv” contains mortality data from a recent mortality investigation. The deaths and exposure data are all in respect of period 1 April 2022 to 31 March 2023 inclusive. The file contains the following variable.
Age : Age last birthday x
Deaths : Number of observed deaths at age x
Exposure : Central exposed to risk at age x
Graduation 1 : Central mortality rate at age x, mx, derived from graduation 1
Graduation 2 : Central mortality rate at age x, mx, derived from graduation 2
Due to unavailability of your colleague, your head of department has asked you to perform following steps and conduct the tests.
i) Calculate individual standardise deviation Zx for each of the graduations. Display first 10 values of the data.
(3)
ii) Calculate the third differences of graduated quantities for both the graduations and comment on the smoothness of each graduation. Paste first 10 values of the third differences column in your data.
(3)
iii) Comment on the goodness of fit using chi square test for each of the graduations given that members of degree of freedom are as follows:
Graduation 1
Graduation 2
46
47

iv) Determine number of positive and negative derivatives for each graduation.
(3)
v) Carry out a 2-tailed sign test using a null hypothesis that P ~ Binomial (m,1/2) using R, where m is the age.
(3)
vi) Determine the number of groups of positive deviations for each of the graduation.
(3)
vii) Determine p value of the grouping of signs test for each graduation.
Hint: Function choose(n,r) in R for binomial coefficient may be used.
(3)
viii) Perform a serial correlation test for each of the graduation at lag 1.
(3)
ix) Perform cumulative deviations test on of the graduation and comment on the bias of the graduation rates.
(3)
x) Based on the finding of your above tests, comment on graduation rates to be published.

<code for reading the input data file> e.g. Std_Table <- read.csv(‘path’/Std_Table.csv") Std_Table$Exmux_1 = Std_Table$Exposure * Std_Table$Graduation_1 Std_Table$Exmux_2 = Std_Table$Exposure * Std_Table$Graduation_2 Std_Table$zx_1 = (Std_Table$Deaths - Std_Table$Exmux_1)/(sqrt(Std_Table$Exmux_1)) Std_Table$zx_2 = (Std_Table$Deaths - Std_Table$Exmux_2)/(sqrt(Std_Table$Exmux_2))

ii) diff_1 = data.frame(grad_1 = diff(Std_Table$Graduation_1),grad_2 = diff(Std_Table$Graduation_2))
diff_2 = data.frame(grad_1 = diff(diff_1$grad_1),grad_2 = diff(diff_1$grad_2))
diff_3 = data.frame(grad_1 = diff(diff_2$grad_1),grad_2 = diff(diff_2$grad_2))
head(diff_3, 10) grad_1 grad_2 1 1.000000e-06 0.000282 2 -2.710505e-19 0.000031 3 1.000000e-06 -0.000054 4 1.000000e-06 -0.000077 5 -1.000000e-06 -0.000040 6 3.000000e-06 0.000029 7 -1.000000e-06 0.000060 8 1.000000e-06 0.000046 9 3.000000e-06 0.000012 10 -1.000000e-06 -0.000026
The third differences are larger for Graduation 2 than for Graduation 1 and they progress in less regular manner and hence Graduation 2 is not as smooth as Graduation 1.
[3]
iii) chisq = vector(length = 2) chisq[1] = sum(Std_Table$zx_1^2) chisq[2] = sum(Std_Table$zx_2^2) df = c(46,47) 1 - pchisq(chisq, df = df) [1] 1.332268e-15 0.000000e+00
The p-value for graduation 1 is 1.332268e-15
The p-value for graduation 2 is 0.000000e+00
Graduation-2 is overfitted as observed the respective p-value.
[3]
iv) positive = vector(length = 2) > negative = vector(length = 2) > positive[1] = length(Std_Table$zx_1[Std_Table$zx_1 > 0]) > positive[2] = length(Std_Table$zx_2[Std_Table$zx_2 > 0]) > negative[1] = length(Std_Table$zx_1[Std_Table$zx_1 < 0]) > negative[2] = length(Std_Table$zx_2[Std_Table$zx_2 < 0]) > positive [1] 38 30 > negative [1] 23 31

v)
For Graduation 1 we have more positive values
IAI CS2B-1123
Page 12 of 15
So p value is
2 * P(P>=38) = 2* [1 – P(P <=37)] 2 * (1 - pbinom(37, size = 61, prob = 0.5)) [1] 0.07217744
For Graduation 2 we have more negative values
So p value is
2 * P(P<=30)
2 * pbinom(30, size = 61, prob = 0.5) [1] 1
[3]
vi) groups = vector(length = 2)
for(j in 1:2){positive_z = (Std_Table[, j+7]>0)*1 + groups[j] = sum(duplicated(c(which(positive_z == 1) - 1, which(positive_z == 0 )))*1) + positive_z[1]*1} groups [1] 12 14
[3]
vii) pvalue = vector(length = 2)
for (j in 1:2){pvalue[j]=0 + for (k in 1 : groups[j]){pvalue[j]= pvalue[j]+choose(positive[j]-1,k-1)* choose(negative[j]+1,k)/choose(positive[j]+negative[j], positive[j])}} pvalue [1] 0.09281982 0.26299014
[3]
viii) scf = vector(length = 2) m = length(Std_Table$Age)
for (j in 1:2) {scf[j] = (cor(Std_Table[1:m-1,j+7],Std_Table[2:m,j+7])*1)*sqrt(m)}
scf [1] 1.2153759212 -0.0003617506
For Graduation 1 , p value is less than 1.6449, the upper 5% point of standard normal distribution so there is no evidence of grouping of deviations of the same sign.
For Graduation 2, the p – value is negative and close to 0, indicating nearby values of Zx tend to have opposite values.
[3]
ix) cdt = vector(length = 2)
for (j in 1:2) {cdt[j] = (sum(Std_Table$Deaths) - sum(Std_Table[,j+5]))/sqrt(sum(Std_Table[,j+5]))} > cdt [1] 3.767196 -30.221501
Graduation 1 p value is higher than 2.5% points of N(0,1) i.e. 1.96, there is sufficient evidence to reject null hypothesis. Therefore, there is bias in the Graduated rates 1.
Graduation 2 has high magnitude of negative test statistic that means, the bias in graduated rates is too high.
[3]
x)
Based on above tests,
• Graduation 1 is smoother than Graduation 2
• Both the graduation passes the goodness of fit, but Graduation 2 seems to be overfitted
IAI CS2B-1123
Page 13 of 15
• Signs test indicates slightly higher positive signs for Graduation 1 as compared to Graduation 2, however p value for both the Graduation passes the test and thus the rates are not biased.
• Grouping of signs test & Serial correlation test shows no evidence of grouping of deviations of the same sign.
• Both the graduation has biasedness as having large positive or negative deviation. However, the biasedness seems to be too high for Graduation 2.
• Thus, both the graduation are good fit, however, Graduation 2 is slightly overfitted and less smooth and thus I would suggest Graduation 1 to be published.
