This exercise introduces the fundamentals of **survival analysis** in the context of sports injury recovery. Using data on long-distance athletes with ankle injuries, it explores how treatment type (pain relief vs. physiotherapy) and prior injury history affect recovery time. Students are guided through:

- Loading and inspecting survival data in R  
- Understanding censoring and its implications  
- Estimating and visualizing Kaplan‚ÄìMeier survival curves  
- Fitting a Cox proportional hazards model with covariates  
- Interpreting model outputs to assess treatment effectiveness and injury history  

The exercise blends statistical reasoning with hands-on coding, emphasizing how survival models can inform medical and rehabilitation decisions.

The dataset **CS2B_A24_Q3.csv** captures recovery outcomes for long-distance athletes who have experienced ankle injuries. It‚Äôs structured for survival analysis and includes the following variables:

- **time**: The number of weeks until recovery or censoring (i.e., when the athlete leaves the study before recovering).  
- **leave**: A binary indicator‚Äî`1` if full recovery time is observed, `0` if the athlete exited the study early (censored).  
- **route**: Treatment type‚Äî`0` for pain relief drugs and rest, `1` for physiotherapy.  
- **prior**: Injury history‚Äî`1` if the athlete had a previous ankle injury within the last 36 months, `0` otherwise.

This dataset is ideal for modeling time-to-event data, comparing treatment effectiveness, and assessing how prior injuries influence recovery duration. It supports both Kaplan‚ÄìMeier estimation and Cox proportional hazards modeling.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è CS2B A2024‚Äì5: Survival Analysis of Athlete Recovery

A study investigates the number of weeks it takes for long-distance athletes with ankle injuries to recover and resume running. The dataset `CS2B_A24_Q3.csv` contains information on each athlete, including:

### üìÅ Dataset Variables
- **time**: Number of weeks until recovery or censoring  
- **leave**:  
  - `1` if full recovery time is recorded  
  - `0` if the athlete left the study before recovery (censored)  
- **route**:  
  - `0` for treatment with pain relief drugs and rest  
  - `1` for physiotherapy instead of drugs  
- **prior**:  
  - `1` if the athlete had a previous ankle injury in the last 36 months  
  - `0` otherwise

### üì¶ Required R Package
Before starting, install and load the `survival` package:

```r
install.packages("survival")
library(survival)
```

### üîç Questions

**(i)** Write R code to:
- Load the dataset into a dataframe named `study`
- Display the first 12 rows

**(ii)** Provide an example of how censoring might be:
- **Informative** for each treatment route  
- **Non-informative** for each treatment route

**(iii)** Write R code to:
- Compute Kaplan‚ÄìMeier survival estimates for recovery time  
- Separate estimates by treatment route (pain relief vs. physiotherapy)  
- Plot both survival curves on the same graph using different colors  
**[8 marks]**

**(iv)** Briefly explain the conclusions that can be drawn from the survival curves in part (iii)  
**[3 marks]**

**(v)** Write R code to:
- Fit a Cox proportional hazards model using `route` and `prior` as covariates  
- Use the **Breslow method** for handling ties  
- Display the regression coefficients  
**[6 marks]**

**(vi)** Comment on which factor‚Äîtreatment route or prior injury‚Äîappears more influential in predicting recovery time, based on the Cox model results  
**[4 marks]**

**(vii)** Describe how you could formally test which of the two covariates is more important in the model
