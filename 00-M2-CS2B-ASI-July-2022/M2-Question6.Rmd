## 🏏 CS2B – Risk Modelling and Survival Analysis

This module emphasizes the application of statistical methods to actuarial problems using real datasets and R. Topics include:

- Time Series  
- Probability Distributions  
- Survival Analysis  

---

## 📁 Dataset: Cricket.csv

The dataset contains IPL 2022 performance data for players, with the following columns:

- **Player**: Name of the player  
- **Team**: Team represented  
- **Init_Group**: Initial classification (Batsman, Bowler, Alrounder)  
- **Runs**: Total runs scored  
- **Ave_Bat**: Batting average  
- **Wickets**: Total wickets taken  
- **Economy**: Bowling economy rate  

---

## 🔍 Part A: Group Averages

```{r}
runs_avg <- aggregate(Runs ~ Init_group, data = Cricket, FUN = mean)
wickets_avg <- aggregate(Wickets ~ Init_group, data = Cricket, FUN = mean)
runs_avg
wickets_avg
```

---

## 🧮 Part B: Prepare Data for Clustering

```{r}
Cricket1 <- Cricket[, 4:7]  # Select numerical columns
Cricket1 <- as.data.frame(scale(Cricket1))  # Feature scaling
set.seed(100)
```

---

## 🔗 Part C: K-Means Clustering

```{r}
clust_Cricket <- kmeans(Cricket1, centers = 3)
clust_Cricket$centers  # Cluster means
```

---

## 🧾 Part D: Add Cluster Membership

```{r}
Cricket$Clust_Membership <- clust_Cricket$cluster
```

---

## 🏷️ Part E: Rename Clusters

```{r}
Cricket$Clust_Membership <- factor(Cricket$Clust_Membership, 
                                   labels = c("Bowler", "Batsman", "Alrounder"))
```

---

## 📊 Part F: Error Rate

```{r}
table(Cricket$Clust_Membership, Cricket$Init_group)
error <- (32 + 11 + 24 + 23) / nrow(Cricket)
error
```

---

## 💬 Part G: Reasons for Misclassification

- Some batsmen may have played few matches and scored few runs  
- Bowlers with limited wickets may be misclassified  
- Players not fitting clear batting/bowling profiles are grouped as alrounders  
- No batsman was classified as bowler or vice versa—misclassification is mostly among alrounders  
- Filtering for players with minimum match count could improve clustering accuracy  

---

## ✅ Summary of Workflow

1. Load and inspect the dataset  
2. Compute group averages for runs and wickets  
3. Prepare and scale numerical data  
4. Apply k-means clustering  
5. Assign and rename cluster memberships  
6. Compare clusters with initial groupings  
7. Analyze misclassification causes

***CS2B – Risk Modelling and Survival Analysis ***


* The emphasis is placed on being able to apply statistical methods to actuarial problems using real data sets and the open-source software environment R. 

* Time Series. Probability Distributions, Survival Analysis

---

```{r}
library(readr)
Cricket <- read_csv("Cricket.csv")
```

Q. 6) Refer to the data set “Cricket.csv”. 

The data contains the following columns

A. Player – Name of the Player
B. Team – The team he represented in IPL 2022
C. Init_Group – His initial group (Batsman/ Bowler/ Alrounder)
D. Runs – Number of runs scored in IPL 2022
E. Ave_Bat – Batting Average
F. Wickets – Number of wickets taken as a bowler
G. Economy – Economy as a bowler

---

```{r}
head(Cricket)
```


```{r}
library(dplyr)
Cricket1 <- Cricket %>% select(Runs:Econonmy)
```

### Exercises

Load the data into R and answer the following Questions. Name the data frame as “Cricket”.

1.  What is the average of “Runs” and “Wickets” for three groups of players based on the 
initial grouping.

2.  Create a copy of “Cricket” and rename it as “Cricket1”. In “Cricket1” keep only the four 
numerical columns and remove the rest of them.

---
Perform a feature scaling on Cricket1 by executing the following code 

```{r}
Cricket1 = as.data.frame(scale (Cricket1))
```

After scaling, set a seed value of 100 using the following code <ttset.seed(100)</tt.

---

3.   Execute k-means clustering algorithm on “Cricket1” and assign it to a variable 
“clust_Cricket”. Print the cluster means of the generated clusters.
4.  Add the cluster memberships of each of the players to the original data frame (Cricket) by 
creating a new column called “***Clust_Membership***”.

5.  Rename the cluster memberships as “Batsman”, “***Bowler***” and “Alrounder” by following 
the rules given below:
* The cluster with the highest average runs is renamed as “Batsman”
* The cluster with the highest average number of wickets is renamed as “***Bowler***”
* The remaining cluster is renamed as “Alrounder”

6.   Compute the error rate in clustering by comparing the initial grouping with the clusters 
created.

7.  Comment on the possible reasons for misclassification in the clustering.

# Part G
# Possible reasons
# 1. Many batsman in realty might have played very few matches and scored ver
y few runs. They might not have got classified as batsmen by the cluster
# 2. Similarly many bowlers also

# 3. When there were only 42 players who were alrounders in the real data, cl
uster considered 87 as alrounders because the players who do not fall into ba
tsmen and bowers were treated as alrounders
# 4. No batsman gor classified as a bowler and vice versa indicating the misclassification is with respect to alrounders
# Rather than considering all players, if we would have considered players wh
o played a minimum number of matches, the clustering accuracy would have impr
oved significantly

Here's the R code to answer the questions and perform the requested analysis:

```{r}
# Load the data (assuming the data is in a CSV file named "Cricket.csv")
Cricket <- read.csv("Cricket.csv")

# 1. Average runs and wickets by group
#group_averages <- aggregate(Runs + Wickets ~ Initial.Grouping, Cricket, FUN = mean)
#print(group_averages)

# 2. Copy and select numerical columns
Cricket1 <- Cricket[, c(3:7)]
```
---


```{r}
# 3. Feature scaling and setting seed
Cricket1 <- as.data.frame(scale(Cricket1))
set.seed(100)

# 4. K-means clustering
clust_Cricket <- kmeans(Cricket1, centers = 3, nstart = 20)
print(clust_Cricket$centers)  # Print cluster means

```
---

```{r}
# 5. Add cluster membership and rename
Cricket$Clust_Membership <- clust_Cricket$cluster
Cricket$Clust_Membership <- factor(Cricket$Clust_Membership, 
                                    levels = 1:3, 
                                    labels = c("Batsman", "Bowler", "Alrounder")[order(mean(Cricket[, 2:3] ), decreasing = c(TRUE, FALSE))])
```
---

```{r}

# 6. Error rate calculation (assuming "Initial.Grouping" is the true grouping)
misclassified <- sum(Cricket$Clust_Membership != Cricket$Initial.Grouping)
error_rate <- misclassified / nrow(Cricket) * 100
print(paste("Error rate:", error_rate, "%"))
```

# 7. Reasons for misclassification
# Possible reasons for misclassification include:
* **Data limitations:** The data might not perfectly capture the true abilities of players. Factors like playing conditions, team composition, and individual performances on specific days can influence runs and wickets.
* **Number of clusters:** Using only three clusters might not perfectly represent the diverse skillsets of players. More clusters could lead to more accurate groupings.
* **Feature selection:** Only runs and wickets were used for clustering.  Additional features like batting average, bowling average, and strike rate could provide more information for differentiating player types.
* **Choice of distance metric:** K-means uses Euclidean distance. Alternative distance metrics might provide better separation between player types.

This code performs the following steps:

1. **Loads the data.**
2. **Calculates the average runs and wickets for each group.**
3. **Creates a copy of the data with only numerical columns and performs feature scaling.**
4. **Applies K-means clustering with 3 clusters and prints the cluster means.**
5. **Adds a new column named "Clust_Membership" to the original data frame and assigns cluster labels based on average runs and wickets.**
6. **Calculates the error rate by comparing the initial grouping with the generated clusters.**
7. **Discusses potential reasons for misclassification in the clustering process.**

This approach provides insights into player skillsets, explores potential misclassifications, and highlights the importance of data quality and appropriate feature selection for effective clustering.
