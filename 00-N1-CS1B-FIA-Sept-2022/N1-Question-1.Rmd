1 A Systems Actuary is developing an automated application to replace a 
time-consuming manual process. It is assumed that the number of errors, X, under this 
automated application process follows a Poisson distribution with mean 6. The 
Actuary wants to perform an analysis on the error rate for the automated process, 
using the sample mean X. 
Use the command set.seed(2022) to initialise the random number generator. 
(i) Determine an estimate for the mean and variance of the sample mean X by 
implementing 5,000 Monte Carlo repetitions, each involving a sample of size 
150 from the assumed Poisson distribution. You should save the Monte Carlo 
X values for later use. 

---

The Actuary recalls that a Normal approximation can be used, by referring to the 
central limit theorem. 
(ii) Write down the approximate distribution of X, by using the central limit 
theorem.  
(iii) Compare the approximation in part (2) with your answer to part (1).  
The Actuary wants to justify using the Normal approximation by comparing all the 
quantiles in one go of X and the Normal distribution, using a QQ plot. 

---
### Exercises
(iv) Construct a QQ plot for X and the Normal distribution, using the Monte Carlo 
X values produced in part (1). 
(v) Comment on the plot from part (4).

Q1
(i)
```{r}
set.seed(2022)
x_bar <- rep(0,5000) 
for (i in 1:5000) {
  x <- rpois(150,6) 
  x_bar[i] <- mean(x)
  } 
mean(x_bar) 
````
> var(x_bar) 
 0.03958983 
(ii)

---


From the Central Limit Theorem, the distribution of the sample means will be
approximately:
𝑁𝑁 �6, 6
150� , i. e. $𝑁(6 , 0.04) $
(iii)
The mean and variance from part (i) are very close to the approximate Normal 
distribution in part (ii) 

---

(iv)

```{r}
qqnorm(x_bar) 
qqline(x_bar)
```



---

### Part (5)

* The QQ plot shows that the quantiles of x_bar and the Normal distribution are very 
similar 
* Therefore, the Normal distribution is a good approximation for x_bar 
* x_bar has a slightly lighter upper tail than the Normal distribution 
* x_bar also has a slightly lighter lower tail than the Normal distribution 
* The approximation will improve with larger sample sizes

This question was answered well by most candidates. 
There were some errors in specifying the variance in part (ii).
In part (iv), well prepared candidates were able to produce a QQ plot along with 
reasonable comments. A common error in part (iv) was using random values rather than 
the quantiles of the distribution to produce the plot.
In part (v), a relatively small proportion of candidates were able to identify and interpret 
differences in the tails.
