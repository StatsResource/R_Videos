library(magrittr)

In an insurance company’s portfolio, individual claim sizes, in \$, follow an exponential distribution with rate parameter $\lambda = 0.0001$.


In R console run the following code: ``set.seed(123)``

and then use R to simulate 10,000 claims and plot a histogram of the simulated data. 


```{r}
set.seed(123)

claims <- rexp(10000, 0.0001)

hist(claims, main = "Histogram of 10,000 Simulated Claims Values from the Exponential Distribution")

```

---

## Exercise 2

#### Part (a)

Calculate the mean and the variance of the simulated claims in ***Exercise 1***.

```{r}
mean(claims)

var(claims)
```

---

```{r}
library(magrittr)  # pipe operator %>%

mean(claims) %>% round(3)

var(claims)   %>% round(3)

library(scales)* # Comma



mean(claims) %>% comma()

var(claims)  %>% comma()

```

---

#### Part B

Compare your answers to part (ii)(a) with the theoretical values expected from the exponential distribution with parameter 0.0001.



* *  The theoretical value of the mean should be 1/0.0001 = 10,000.

* *  The theoretical value of the variance should be (1/0.0001^2 ) = 100,000,000 

* *  The simulated values are very close to the theoretical values. 

* *  The difference is due to sampling error

### Exercise 3

The insurer decides to take out an individual excess of loss reinsurance arrangement with a retention level of $20,000.


Calculate the mean and the variance of the claims paid, under this arrangement, by
(a) the insurer
(b) the reinsurer.

The insurer wishes to determine an appropriate retention limit and has asked an analyst to investigate the effect of different retention limits on the mean and variance
of claims.

(iv)
Calculate the mean and variance of the claims paid by:
(a)
(b)
the insurer
the reinsurer
under each of the following six retention levels:
£5,000, £10,000, £20,000, £30,000, £40,000 and £50,000.

(b)
For the reinsurer:

mean(ReClaims3)
 1366.485
var(ReClaims3)

Comment, with reference to the total variance, on your results in part (v).[6]

vi)
The mean claim amount paid by the insurer increases in size with the retention limit
but at a decreasing rate.

It tends towards the unrestricted mean as the retention limit increases 
The mean claim amount paid by the reinsurer is equal to the total mean claim
minus the mean amount paid by the insurer 
Hence the mean claim amount paid by the reinsurer decreases in size with the
retention limit also at a decreasing rate. 
The trends in the variance of the claims for the insurer and the reinsurer
are not “mirror images”. 
Among the six retention limits investigated, the sum of the variance of the reinsurer
and the insurer reaches a minimum at a retention limit of around £20,000


(
TotalVar <- VarIns + VarRe
TotalVar
 87057204 72904822 69012424 79547654 89827408
94676012

This suggests that this retention limit might be the most appropriate in practice.

OR: Alternative relevant solutions based on conditional distribution of the
reinsurer is accepted. In this case,

and the insurer is at a minimum at a retention limit of around £5,000

Parts (i) to (iv) were very well answered.

Although most candidates scored highly in part (ii), only a few candidates received full marks. Most candidates lost marks for not explaining why the mean and variance of the simulated claims were not the same as the theoretical values.
Answers to part (v) were mixed. Graphs had to be clearly labelled to score full marks.

Part (vi) was answered poorly. Many candidates did not comment on the total variance, despite being asked to do so in the question. Appropriate alternative comments received
credit here. To be appropriate, the comments had to relate to the results in part (v).

In parts (iii) to (vi) full credit was awarded to candidates who calculated the mean and variance of the Reinsurer’s claims based on the conditional distribution i.e. only claims
over the retention limit.
