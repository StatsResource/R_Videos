An insurance company, which currently only sells home insurance, is interested in 
entering the car insurance market. An underwriting manager at the company believes 
that the age and gender of the policyholder will be the most important factors in 
estimating the number of claims made under a car insurance policy. 
The underwriting manager has commissioned a survey of its current home insurance 
customers who also have car insurance, choosing a male customer and a female 
customer for every age from 18 to 65, asking them how many car insurance  
claims they have made in the past 3 years. This dataset is saved in the file 
ClaimsData.Rdata. After loading this data into R, using the command 
load("ClaimsData.Rdata"), the data frame ClaimsData will be available, 
which contains the following three variables: 
age – this is the age (in years) of the policyholder. 
gender – this is either ‘M’ for male or ‘F’ for female. 
claim_count – this is the number of car insurance claims reported by the 
policyholder over the past 3 years. 
(i) 
Fit a normal linear regression model to the data using claim_count as the 
response variable and age as the explanatory variable. Your answer should 
include the estimated intercept and slope of the regression line. 
[3] 
A colleague suggests that the response variable would be better modelled as having a 
Poisson distribution. 
(ii) 
Fit a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) to the data using claim_count as 
the response variable and age as the explanatory variable, assuming a Poisson 
distribution for the response variable. Your answer should include the 
estimated coefficients and the Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) of the 
fitted model. 
[4] 
The underwriting manager wishes to compare the fit of the GLM in part (ii) against 
that of the normal linear regression model in part (i). 
(iii) 
(iv) 
Explain why scaled deviances cannot be used to compare the fit of the models 
in parts (i) and (ii). 
[3] 
Fit, by choosing a suitable argument for family in the glm command, a 
GLM to the data that is equivalent to the model fitted in part (i). Your answer 
should include the estimated coefficients and the AIC of this fitted model. [4] 
(v) 
Compare the fit of the models fitted in parts (ii) and (iv).

The underwriting manager believes the Poisson GLM would be improved by adding 
the explanatory variable gender as well as its interaction with age. 
(vi) 
(a) 
(b) 
Fit a Poisson GLM to the data of the form age*gender. Your 
answer should include the estimated coefficients and the AIC of this 
fitted model. 
Compare, using scaled deviances, the fit of this model to that in  
part (ii).
