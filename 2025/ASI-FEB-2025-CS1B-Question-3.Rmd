### Solution to Question 3: Statistical Analysis of Exam Marks

This exercise analyzes exam marks given by two different examiners to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in their marking standards. It uses both visual comparisons and formal hypothesis tests.

#### i) Visual Comparison of Exam Mark Distributions

The first step is to visualize the distribution of marks given by two associate examiners (AE1 and AE2) using bar plots. The marks are grouped into ranges (e.g., 0-10, 11-20, etc.).

```r
axis <- c("0-10", "11-20", "21-30", "31-40", "41-50", "51-60", "61-70", "71-80", "81-90", "91-100")

# Bar plot for Associate Examiner 1
barplot(marks_AE1, xlab = "Exam Mark Groups", ylab = "Number of Exams",
        main = "Exam Marks for AE 1", col = "Red", names.arg = axis, ylim = c(0, 40))

# Bar plot for Associate Examiner 2
barplot(marks_AE2, xlab = "Exam Mark Groups", ylab = "Number of Exams",
        main = "Exam Marks for AE 2", col = "Purple", names.arg = axis, ylim = c(0, 50))
```

#### ii) Interpretation of Visuals

Based on the bar plots, the distributions of marks for both examiners appear somewhat similar, especially for the middle scores. 

However, there are some differences at the extremes (low and high scores). 

The plot for AE1 seems to roughly resemble a normal distribution, while the plot for AE2 shows some skewness. 

Overall, the visual evidence suggests a general consistency between the two examiners.

#### iii) Paired t-test for Difference in Means

To formally test for a difference in the mean marks, a **paired t-test** is conducted. A paired test is appropriate here because it is assumed that the marks are for the same 10 students or papers, evaluated by both examiners.

  * **Null Hypothesis ($H\_0$):** The true mean difference in marks is zero.
  * **Alternative Hypothesis ($H\_1$):** The true mean difference in marks is not equal to zero.

<!-- end list -->

```r
AE_1 <- c(4, 1, 5, 1, 4, 6, 4, 5, 3, 6)
AE_2 <- c(3, 2, 4, 0, 3, 4, 2, 3, 3, 6)

t.test(AE_1, AE_2, paired = TRUE, var.equal = TRUE)
```

**Results:** The p-value from the test is **0.01872**.

**Conclusion:** Since the p-value (0.01872) is less than the significance level of 0.05, we **reject the null hypothesis**. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a statistically significant difference in the marking of the two examiners at the 5% level. The 95% confidence interval for the mean difference is **[0.1886, 1.6114]**, which does not contain zero.

#### iv) F-test for Equality of Variances

Before a t-test can be conducted on two independent samples, it is important to check if the assumption of equal variances holds true. An **F-test** is used for this purpose.

  * **Null Hypothesis ($H\_0$):** The ratio of the two variances is equal to 1 (i.e., the variances are equal).
  * **Alternative Hypothesis ($H\_1$):** The ratio of the two variances is not equal to 1 (i.e., the variances are not equal).

<!-- end list -->

```r
var.test(x = AE_1, y = AE_2, level = 0.95)
```

**Results:** The p-value from the test is **0.6911**.

**Conclusion:** Since the p-value (0.6911) is greater than 0.05, we **fail to reject the null hypothesis**. The assumption of equal variances holds true at the 5% significance level.

#### v) Two-Sample Independent t-test

This part of the exercise assumes the two sets of marks are from different exams (not the same papers). Therefore, a **two-sample independent t-test** is more appropriate.

```r
AE_1_First_Paper <- c(4, 1, 5, 1, 4, 6, 4, 5, 3, 6)
AE_2_Second_Paper <- c(3, 2, 4, 0, 3, 4, 2, 3, 3, 6)

t.test(AE_1_First_Paper, AE_2_Second_Paper, paired = FALSE, var.equal = TRUE)
```

**Results:** The 95% confidence interval for the mean difference is **[-0.6799, 2.4799]**. The p-value is **0.2469**.

#### vi) Comparison and Final Conclusion

The results from the two tests lead to different conclusions:

  * **Paired t-test:** The p-value was **0.01872**, leading to the conclusion that there **is a significant difference** in marking.
  * **Two-sample independent t-test:** The p-value was **0.2469**, leading to the conclusion that there is **no significant difference** in marking.

The difference in conclusions highlights the importance of choosing the correct statistical test. The paired t-test is more powerful because it accounts for the variability between the papers themselves, which an independent t-test ignores. Since the marks were for the same papers, the paired test provides a more accurate and reliable result for comparing the examiners.
