### Solution to Question 1: Bootstrap Estimation

This exercise demonstrates the use of **bootstrap methods** to estimate a population parameter from a small sample. Specifically, it compares the **non-parametric bootstrap** and the **parametric bootstrap** to estimate the sampling distribution of the mean.

#### i) Initial Data

The analysis begins with a small sample dataset:

```r
data <- c(14.8, 17.6, 11.2, 13.5, 12.9, 10.8, 10.5, 12.3)
```

#### ii) Non-Parametric Bootstrap

This method resamples from the original data with replacement to create a large number of "new" datasets. The mean of each resampled dataset is then calculated to create an empirical sampling distribution of the mean.

```r
set.seed(2025)
# Using a for loop:
estimate <- rep(0, 1000)
for (i in 1:1000) {
  x <- sample(data, replace = TRUE)
  estimate[i] <- mean(x)
}

# Alternate, more concise code using replicate:
estimate <- replicate(1000, mean(sample(data, replace = TRUE)))
```

The result is 1000 bootstrapped estimates of the mean.

#### iii) Visualizing the Non-Parametric Bootstrap Distribution

A histogram and a density plot are used to visualize the distribution of the 1000 non-parametric bootstrap estimates.

```r
hist(estimate, prob = TRUE, main = "Histogram: Non-Parametric Bootstrap", xlab = "Value of Estimator")
lines(density(estimate), col = "blue")
```

The histogram shows the shape of the sampling distribution.

#### iv) Summary Statistics for Non-Parametric Bootstrap

The mean and standard deviation of the bootstrapped estimates are calculated.

  - **Mean of Estimates:** `mean(estimate)` = 12.95271
  - **Standard Deviation of Estimates:** `sd(estimate)` = 0.7647271

The standard deviation, often called the **bootstrap standard error**, provides an estimate of the variability of the sample mean.

#### v) Parametric Bootstrap

This method assumes that the original data comes from a specific probability distribution (in this case, an exponential distribution). It then uses the estimated parameters of this distribution to generate new, synthetic datasets. The mean of the original data is used to estimate the rate parameter of the exponential distribution ($1/\\lambda$).

```r
set.seed(2025)
# Using a for loop:
param.estimate <- rep(0, 1000)
for (i in 1:1000) {
  # Generate 8 values from an exponential distribution
  x <- rexp(8, rate = 1 / mean(data))
  param.estimate[i] <- mean(x)
}

# Alternate, more concise code using replicate:
param.estimate <- replicate(1000, mean(rexp(8, rate = 1 / mean(data))))
```

This generates 1000 new estimates based on the exponential model.

#### vi) Visualizing the Parametric Bootstrap Distribution

A histogram and a density plot are used to visualize the distribution of the 1000 parametric bootstrap estimates.

```r
hist(param.estimate, prob = TRUE, main = "Histogram: Parametric Bootstrap", xlab = "Value of Estimator")
lines(density(param.estimate), col = "red")
```

This histogram shows the sampling distribution under the assumption of an exponential model.

#### vii) Summary Statistics for Parametric Bootstrap

  - **Mean of Estimates:** `mean(param.estimate)` = 13.06449
  - **Standard Deviation of Estimates:** `sd(param.estimate)` = 4.675508

-----

#### viii) Estimating the Rate Parameter ($\\lambda$)

The exercise also estimates the rate parameter of the exponential distribution using three different methods:

  - **Method of Moments:** `1 / mean(data)` = 0.07722
  - **Non-Parametric Bootstrap:** `1 / mean(estimate)` = 0.07720
  - **Parametric Bootstrap:** `1 / mean(param.estimate)` = 0.07654

The results from all three methods are very similar, which is expected.

#### ix) Comparison of the Two Bootstrap Methods

The two histograms show a key difference:

  * The **parametric bootstrap distribution** has a much wider spread and a longer tail compared to the non-parametric distribution.
  * This is confirmed by the standard deviations: the standard deviation of the parametric estimates (**4.68**) is significantly higher than that of the non-parametric estimates (**0.76**).

This highlights that the parametric method's results are more sensitive to the assumption of a specific underlying distribution (in this case, exponential), which may not accurately reflect the true data-generating process, leading to higher variability in the estimates.
