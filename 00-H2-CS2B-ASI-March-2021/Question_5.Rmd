Q. 5) A primary school has two wings A and B. The students can change their Wing freely. It was 
observed that the rate of movement is dependent on the age ‘x’ of the student (ranging from 
5 to 15). The rate of movement from A to B = [0.08*x – 0.2] and the rate of movement from 
B to A = [0.05 * x + 0.1]. 
i) Write a code to calculate the generator matrix G(x). Calculate the rate at which a 12 
year old student will move from wing B to A and from A to B. 
ii) Over a very small time period h, the transition probability matrix P(t,t+h) can be 
approximated as P(t,t+h) = I + h*G(t); I is the identity matrix. Using this, calculate the 
probability that a 8 year old will move to Wing B in next 5 years in case h=1/365.

[2,] 0.70 -0.70 
Thus, the rates are 0.70 (from B to A) and 0.76 (from A to B).
