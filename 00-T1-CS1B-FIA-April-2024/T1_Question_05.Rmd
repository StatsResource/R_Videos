An insurance company, which currently only sells home insurance, is interested in
entering the car insurance market. An underwriting manager at the company believes
that the age and gender of the policyholder will be the most important factors in
estimating the number of claims made under a car insurance policy.
The underwriting manager has commissioned a survey of its current home insurance
customers who also have car insurance, choosing a male customer and a female
customer for every age from 18 to 65, asking them how many car insurance
claims they have made in the past 3 years.

## 📁 Data

The dataset is saved in the file `ClaimsData.Rdata`. After loading it into R using:

```r
load("ClaimsData.Rdata")
```

The data frame `ClaimsData` will be available, containing the following variables:

- **age**: Age of the policyholder (in years)  
- **gender**: `'M'` for male or `'F'` for female  
- **claim_count**: Number of car insurance claims reported by the policyholder over the past 3 years

---

##  Exercises

### (i) Linear Regression  
Fit a **normal linear regression model** using `claim_count` as the response variable and `age` as the explanatory variable.  
- Include the estimated **intercept** and **slope** of the regression line.

> A colleague suggests that the response variable may be better modeled using a **Poisson distribution**.

---

### (ii) Poisson GLM  
Fit a **Generalised Linear Model (GLM)** assuming a **Poisson distribution** for `claim_count`, with `age` as the explanatory variable.  
- Report the **estimated coefficients** and the **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)** of the fitted model.

---

### (iii) Model Comparison  
Explain why **scaled deviances** cannot be used to compare the fit of the models in parts (i) and (ii).

---

### (iv) GLM Equivalent to Linear Regression  
Fit a GLM equivalent to the model in part (i) by choosing a suitable `family` argument in the `glm()` function.  
- Report the **estimated coefficients** and the **AIC** of this fitted model.  
**[4 marks]**

---

### (v) Compare Model Fits  
Compare the fit of the models from parts (ii) and (iv) using appropriate criteria.

---

### (vi) Extended Poisson GLM  
The underwriting manager believes the Poisson GLM can be improved by including `gender` and its interaction with `age`.

**(a)** Fit a Poisson GLM using the formula `age * gender`.  
- Report the **estimated coefficients** and the **AIC** of the fitted model.

**(b)** Compare the fit of this model to that in part (ii) using **scaled deviances**.  
**[7 marks]**

### (i) Fit a normal linear regression model to the data using claim_count as the response variable and age as the explanatory variable:

```r
load("ClaimsData.Rdata")
model_lin <- lm(claim_count ~ age)
model_lin$coefficients
```
**Output:**
```
(Intercept)        age 
  4.29414532  -0.05026053
```
The intercept is approximately 4.29 and the slope is approximately -0.05.

---

### (ii) Fit a Generalised Linear Model (GLM) assuming a Poisson distribution:

```r
model_glm_age <- glm(claim_count ~ age, family = poisson)
summary(model_glm_age)
```
**Output:**
```
Coefficients:
(Intercept)    age 
  1.70492  -0.02323

Degrees of Freedom: 95 Total (i.e. Null); 94 Residual
Null Deviance: 149.5
Residual Deviance: 128.2 AIC: 349.8
```
The estimated coefficients for the Poisson GLM are: Intercept = 1.70492, age = -0.02323, and the AIC is 349.8.

---

### (iii) Explain why scaled deviances cannot be used to compare the fit of the models:

Comparison using scaled deviances is only valid for nested models. In this case, the normal linear regression model assumes a normal distribution, whereas the GLM assumes a Poisson distribution. Therefore, neither model is a subset of the other, making scaled deviances inappropriate for comparison.

---

### (iv) Fit a GLM equivalent to the normal linear regression model:

```r
model_lin_glm <- glm(claim_count ~ age, family = gaussian)
summary(model_lin_glm)
```
**Output:**
```
Coefficients:
(Intercept)    age 
  4.29415  -0.05026

Degrees of Freedom: 95 Total (i.e. Null); 94 Residual
Null Deviance: 295.8
Residual Deviance: 249.3 AIC: 370
```
The estimated coefficients for the Gaussian GLM are: Intercept = 4.29415, age = -0.05026, and the AIC is 370.

---

### (v) Compare the fit of the models:

The AIC of the Poisson model (part (ii)) is lower than that of the Gaussian model (part (iv)). Therefore, the Poisson GLM provides a better fit.

---

### (vi) (a) Fit a Poisson GLM with age*gender interaction term:

```r
model_glm_full <- glm(claim_count ~ age*gender, family = poisson)
summary(model_glm_full)
```
**Output:**
```
Coefficients:
(Intercept)    age   genderM  age:genderM 
  1.84642   -0.03459  -0.18217   0.01805

Degrees of Freedom: 95 Total (i.e. Null); 92 Residual
Null Deviance: 149.5
Residual Deviance: 113.5 AIC: 339
```
The estimated coefficients for the full model are: Intercept = 1.84642, age = -0.03459, genderM = -0.18217, age:genderM = 0.01805, and the AIC is 339.

---

### (vi) (b) Compare using scaled deviances:

To compare the models using scaled deviances:

```r
anova(model_glm_age, model_glm_full, test = "Chisq")
```
**Output:**
```
Analysis of Deviance Table
Model 1: claim_count ~ age 
Model 2: claim_count ~ age * gender
Resid. Df Resid. Dev Df Deviance Pr(>Chi)
1  94 128.25 
2  92 113.46 2 14.789 0.0006148 ***
```
The p-value is clearly significant (less than 0.1%). Therefore, the GLM with age*gender is a significant improvement over that with age alone.

(iii)
A comparison using scaled deviances is only valid for nested models. 
The model in (i) assumed a Normal distribution, whilst the model in (ii) assumed a Poisson distribution. Therefore, neither model is a subset of the other. 
(iv)
> model_lin_glm <- glm(claim_count ~ age, family = gaussian) 
> model_lin_glm
# Call: glm(formula = claim_count ~ age, family = gaussian)
Coefficients:
(Intercept) age
4.29415 -0.05026
Degrees of Freedom: 95 Total (i.e. Null); 94 Residual
Null Deviance: 295.8
Residual Deviance: 249.3 AIC: 370 
(v)
The AIC of the Poisson model in part (ii) is lower than that of the Normal model in part (iv).  Therefore, the Poisson GLM provides a better fit. 
(vi)
(a)
> model_glm_full <- glm(claim_count ~ age*gender, family = poisson) 
> model_glm_full
<p>

# Call: glm(formula = claim_count ~ age * gender, family = poisson)
Coefficients:
(Intercept) age genderM age:genderM
1.84642 -0.03459 -0.18217 0.01805
Degrees of Freedom: 95 Total (i.e. Null); 92 Residual
Null Deviance: 149.5
Residual Deviance: 113.5 AIC: 339 
(b) H0: the bigger (full) model is NOT a significant improvement over the simpler model; against H1: it is a significant improvement.
